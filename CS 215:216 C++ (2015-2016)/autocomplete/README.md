# Autocomplete (For CS 216)
A program to input a text file containing queries and weights for terms. The user takes that file as command line input (and an integer after for number of results) and is prompted to search. The search will return the top x terms that match at least partially. It is meant to simulate autocomplete functionality (like a Google search).

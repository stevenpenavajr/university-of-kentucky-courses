so foul and fair a day i have not seen . <eol>
no more than to be cawdor . say from whence <eol>
upon this blasted heath you stop our way <eol>
your children shall be kings . <eol>
which do but what they should by doing every thing <eol>
safe toward your love and honour . <eol>
i 'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful <eol>
strong both against the deed then as his host <eol>
hath borne his faculties so meek hath been <eol>
that tears shall drown the wind . i have no spur <eol>
he hath honour 'd me of late and i have bought <eol>
if we should fail ? <eol>
nothing but males . will it not be received <eol>
when we have mark 'd with blood those sleepy two <eol>
i am settled and bend up <eol>
away and mock the time with fairest show <eol>
being unprepared <eol>
we would spend it in some words upon that business <eol>
if you shall cleave to my consent when 'tis <eol>
good repose the while ! <eol>
proceeding from the heat oppressed brain ? <eol>
which was not so before . there 's no such thing <eol>
moves like a ghost . thou sure and firm set earth <eol>
hear not my steps which way they walk for fear <eol>
i go and it is done the bell invites me . <eol>
when ? <eol>
as i descended ? <eol>
but they did say their prayers and address 'd them <eol>
again to sleep . <eol>
i am afraid to think what i have done <eol>
all is but toys renown and grace is dead <eol>
that had a heart to love and in that heart <eol>
courage to make 's love known ? <eol>
let 's briefly put on manly readiness <eol>
with strange invention but of that to morrow <eol>
craving us jointly . hie you to horse adieu <eol>
and so i do commend you to their backs . farewell . <eol>
sirrah a word with you attend those men <eol>
our pleasure ? <eol>
when first they put the name of king upon me <eol>
and bade them speak to him then prophet like <eol>
and put a barren sceptre in my gripe <eol>
put rancours in the vessel of my peace <eol>
only for them and mine eternal jewel <eol>
and beggar 'd yours for ever ? <eol>
as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs <eol>
distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle <eol>
grapples you to the heart and love of us <eol>
against my near 'st of life and though i could <eol>
with barefaced power sweep him from my sight <eol>
for sundry weighty reasons . <eol>
your spirits shine through you . within this hour at most <eol>
the moment on 't for 't must be done to night <eol>
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work <eol>
whose absence is no less material to me <eol>
if it find heaven must find it out to night . <eol>
remains in danger of her former tooth . <eol>
than on the torture of the mind to lie <eol>
after life 's fitful fever he sleeps well <eol>
so shall i love and so i pray be you <eol>
let your remembrance apply to banquo <eol>
and make our faces vizards to our hearts <eol>
hath rung night 's yawning peal there shall be done <eol>
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day <eol>
and with thy bloody and invisible hand <eol>
'tis better thee without than he within . <eol>
that did the like for fleance if thou didst it <eol>
as broad and general as the casing air <eol>
but now i am cabin 'd cribb 'd confined bound in <eol>
and health on both ! <eol>
thy gory locks at me . <eol>
which might appal the devil . <eol>
those that we bury back our monuments <eol>
i do forget . <eol>
i drink to the general joy o ' the whole table <eol>
and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss <eol>
the baby of a girl . hence horrible shadow ! <eol>
unreal mockery hence ! <eol>
why so being gone <eol>
even to the disposition that i owe <eol>
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks <eol>
when mine is blanched with fear . <eol>
the secret 'st man of blood . what is the night ? <eol>
stepp 'd in so far that should i wade no more <eol>
strange things i have in head that will to hand <eol>
come we 'll to sleep . my strange and self abuse <eol>
we are yet but young in deed . <eol>
their heads to their foundations though the treasure <eol>
tell me thou unknown power <eol>
then live macduff what need i fear of thee ? <eol>
what is this <eol>
of birnam rise and our high placed macbeth <eol>
shall live the lease of nature pay his breath <eol>
i will be satisfied deny me this <eol>
thou other gold bound brow is like the first . <eol>
a third is like the former . filthy hags ! <eol>
another yet ! a seventh ! i 'll see no more <eol>
horrible sight ! now i see 'tis true <eol>
come in without there ! <eol>
infected be the air whereon they ride <eol>
the very firstlings of my heart shall be <eol>
the castle of macduff i will surprise <eol>
that trace him in his line . no boasting like a fool <eol>
this deed i 'll do before this purpose cool . <eol>
i cannot taint with fear . what 's the boy malcolm ? <eol>
'fear not macbeth no man that 's born of woman <eol>
thou lily liver 'd boy . what soldiers patch ? <eol>
death of thy soul ! those linen cheeks of thine <eol>
are counsellors to fear . what soldiers whey face ? <eol>
will cheer me ever or disseat me now . <eol>
as honour love obedience troops of friends <eol>
curses not loud but deep mouth honour breath <eol>
i 'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack 'd . <eol>
how does your patient doctor ? <eol>
cure her of that . <eol>
raze out the written troubles of the brain <eol>
cleanse the stuff 'd bosom of that perilous stuff <eol>
throw physic to the dogs i 'll none of it . <eol>
come sir dispatch . if thou couldst doctor cast <eol>
till birnam forest come to dunsinane . <eol>
hang out our banners on the outward walls <eol>
will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie <eol>
to hear a night shriek and my fell of hair <eol>
there would have been a time for such a word . <eol>
creeps in this petty pace from day to day <eol>
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools <eol>
told by an idiot full of sound and fury <eol>
well say sir . <eol>
i care not if thou dost for me as much . <eol>
that lies like truth 'fear not till birnam wood <eol>
comes toward dunsinane . arm arm and out ! <eol>
they have tied me to a stake i cannot fly <eol>
am i to fear or none . <eol>
my name 's macbeth . <eol>
no nor more fearful . <eol>
but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn <eol>
with blood of thine already . <eol>
thou losest labour <eol>
with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed <eol>
that palter with us in a double sense <eol>
and break it to our hope . i 'll not fight with thee . <eol>
yet i will try the last . before my body <eol>
i throw my warlike shield . lay on macduff <eol>

madam i am here . <eol>
what is your will ? <eol>
for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch <eol>
what 's he that follows there that would not dance ? <eol>
ay me ! <eol>
deny thy father and refuse thy name <eol>
'tis but thy name that is my enemy <eol>
of that tongue 's utterance yet i know the sound <eol>
thou know 'st the mask of night is on my face <eol>
for that which thou hast heard me speak to night <eol>
what i have spoke but farewell compliment ! <eol>
dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say 'ay ' <eol>
thou mayst prove false at lovers ' perjuries <eol>
then say jove laughs . o gentle romeo <eol>
i 'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay <eol>
and therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light <eol>
than those that have more cunning to be strange . <eol>
which the dark night hath so discovered . <eol>
good night good night ! as sweet repose and rest <eol>
what satisfaction canst thou have to night ? <eol>
my love as deep the more i give to thee <eol>
the more i have for both are infinite . <eol>
by one that i 'll procure to come to thee <eol>
and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay <eol>
i have forgot why i did call thee back . <eol>
sweet so would i <eol>
o she is lame ! love 's heralds should be thoughts <eol>
driving back shadows over louring hills <eol>
now is the sun upon the highmost hill <eol>
of this day 's journey and from nine till twelve <eol>
is three long hours yet she is not come . <eol>
had she affections and warm youthful blood <eol>
but old folks many feign as they were dead <eol>
let me be satisfied is 't good or bad ? <eol>
what says he of our marriage ? what of that ? <eol>
'your love says like an honest gentleman <eol>
as much to him else is his thanks too much . <eol>
conceit more rich in matter than in words <eol>
leap to these arms untalk 'd of and unseen . <eol>
hood my unmann 'd blood bating in my cheeks <eol>
come night come romeo come thou day in night <eol>
give me my romeo and when he shall die <eol>
and pay no worship to the garish sun . <eol>
but not possess 'd it and though i am sold <eol>
but romeo 's name speaks heavenly eloquence . <eol>
or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'i . ' <eol>
is romeo slaughter 'd and is tybalt dead ? <eol>
beautiful tyrant ! fiend angelical ! <eol>
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell <eol>
was ever book containing such vile matter <eol>
for such a wish ! he was not born to shame <eol>
when i thy three hours wife have mangled it ? <eol>
some word there was worser than tybalt 's death <eol>
but o it presses to my memory <eol>
but with a rear ward following tybalt 's death <eol>
'romeo is banished ' to speak that word <eol>
take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled <eol>
both you and i for romeo is exiled <eol>
and death not romeo take my maidenhead ! <eol>
and bid him come to take his last farewell . <eol>
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps . <eol>
nurse ? <eol>
for in a minute there are many days <eol>
but send him back . <eol>
who is 't that calls ? is it my lady mother ? <eol>
feeling so the loss <eol>
to bear a poison i would temper it <eol>
to wreak the love i bore my cousin <eol>
madam in happy time what day is that ? <eol>
he shall not make me there a joyful bride . <eol>
i wonder at this haste that i must wed <eol>
i pray you tell my lord and father madam <eol>
not proud you have but thankful that you have <eol>
proud can i never be of what i hate <eol>
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven <eol>
go in and tell my lady i am gone <eol>
so many thousand times ? go counsellor <eol>
if all else fail myself have power to die . <eol>
what must be shall be . <eol>
to answer that i should confess to you . <eol>
o shut the door ! and when thou hast done so <eol>
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it <eol>
god join 'd my heart and romeo 's thou our hands <eol>
by holy laurence to fall prostrate here <eol>
i met the youthful lord at laurence ' cell <eol>
to move the heavens to smile upon my state <eol>
that almost freezes up the heat of life <eol>
subtly hath minister 'd to have me dead <eol>
come to redeem me ? there 's a fearful point ! <eol>
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in <eol>
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes ? <eol>
lies festering in his shroud where as they say <eol>
alack alack is it not like that i <eol>
and madly play with my forefather 's joints ? <eol>
o comfortable friar ! where is my lord ? <eol>
go get thee hence for i will not away . <eol>
haply some poison yet doth hang on them <eol>
thy lips are warm . <eol>
i do confess it and repent it father . <eol>

for murder though it have no tongue will speak <eol>
to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps <eol>
devoutly to be wish 'd . to die to sleep <eol>
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil <eol>
must give us pause there 's the respect <eol>
the pangs of despised love the law 's delay <eol>
to grunt and sweat under a weary life <eol>
i humbly thank you well well well . <eol>

ha ha ! are you honest ? <eol>
force of honesty can translate beauty into his <eol>
likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the <eol>

breeder of sinners ? i am myself indifferent honest <eol>
but yet i could accuse me of such things that it <eol>

in . what should such fellows as i do crawling <eol>
all believe none of us . go thy ways to a nunnery . <eol>
out herods herod pray you avoid it . <eol>
be not too tame neither but let your own discretion <eol>
the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is <eol>
from the purpose of playing whose end both at the <eol>
scorn her own image and the very age and body of <eol>
that neither having the accent of christians nor <eol>
o reform it altogether . and let those that play <eol>
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them <eol>
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to <eol>
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh <eol>
that 's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition <eol>
in the fool that uses it . go make you ready . <eol>
to sound what stop she please . give me that man <eol>
one scene of it comes near the circumstance <eol>
which i have told thee of my father 's death <eol>
and my imaginations are as foul <eol>
as vulcan 's stithy . give him heedful note <eol>
for i mine eyes will rivet to his face <eol>
in censure of his seeming . <eol>
what did you enact ? <eol>
there . be the players ready ? <eol>
mother looks and my father died within these two hours . <eol>
months ago and not forgotten yet ? then there 's <eol>
hope a great man 's memory may outlive his life half <eol>

ay or any show that you 'll show him be not you <eol>
madam how like you this play ? <eol>
o but she 'll keep her word . <eol>

touches us not let the galled jade wince our <eol>
i could interpret between you and your love if i <eol>
he poisons him i ' the garden for 's estate . his <eol>
for some must watch while some must sleep <eol>
this realm dismantled was <eol>
your wisdom should show itself more richer to <eol>
sir i cannot . <eol>
more but to the matter my mother you say <eol>
we shall obey were she ten times our mother . have <eol>
you any further trade with us ? <eol>
o the recorders ! let me see one . to withdraw with <eol>
as if you would drive me into a toil ? <eol>
'tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with <eol>
your lingers and thumb give it breath with your <eol>
excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot <eol>
instrument you will though you can fret me yet you <eol>
cannot play upon me . <eol>
o heart lose not thy nature let not ever <eol>
how in my words soever she be shent <eol>
to give them seals never my soul consent ! <eol>
a villain kills my father and for that <eol>
with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may <eol>
and how his audit stands who knows save heaven ? <eol>
but in our circumstance and course of thought <eol>
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed <eol>
at gaming swearing or about some act <eol>
now mother what 's the matter ? <eol>
and sets a blister there makes marriage vows <eol>
is thought sick at the act . <eol>
new lighted on a heaven kissing hill <eol>
a combination and a form indeed <eol>
you cannot call it love for at your age <eol>
would step from this to this ? sense sure you have <eol>
else could you not have motion but sure that sense <eol>
that thus hath cozen 'd you at hoodman blind ? <eol>
o shame ! where is thy blush ? rebellious hell <eol>
since frost itself as actively doth burn <eol>
and reason panders will . <eol>
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule <eol>
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole <eol>
a king of shreds and patches <eol>
how is it with you lady ? <eol>
on him on him ! look you how pale he glares ! <eol>
his form and cause conjoin 'd preaching to stones <eol>
will want true colour tears perchance for blood . <eol>
why look you there ! look how it steals away ! <eol>
and i the matter will re word which madness <eol>
infects unseen . confess yourself to heaven <eol>
repent what 's past avoid what is to come <eol>
to make them ranker . forgive me this my virtue <eol>
o throw away the worser part of it <eol>
and live the purer with the other half . <eol>
that monster custom who all sense doth eat <eol>
and either . . . the devil or throw him out <eol>
with wondrous potency . once more good night <eol>
i must be cruel only to be kind <eol>
to try conclusions in the basket creep <eol>
whom i will trust as i will adders fang 'd <eol>
and marshal me to knavery . let it work <eol>
for 'tis the sport to have the engineer <eol>
but i will delve one yard below their mines <eol>
safely stowed . <eol>
besides to be demanded of a sponge ! what <eol>
an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to <eol>
the body . the king is a thing <eol>
of nothing bring me to him . hide fox and all after . <eol>
nothing but to show you how a king may go a <eol>
progress through the guts of a beggar . <eol>
stairs into the lobby . <eol>
for england ! <eol>
good . <eol>
why then the polack never will defend it . <eol>
will not debate the question of this straw <eol>
why the man dies . i humbly thank you sir . <eol>
how all occasions do inform against me <eol>
and spur my dull revenge ! what is a man <eol>
looking before and after gave us not <eol>
witness this army of such mass and charge <eol>
has this fellow no feeling of his business that he <eol>
'tis e 'en so the hand of little employment hath <eol>
cain 's jaw bone that did the first murder ! it <eol>
or of a courtier which could say 'good morrow <eol>
here 's fine revolution an we had the trick to <eol>
there 's another why may not that be the skull of a <eol>
his cases his tenures and his tricks ? why does he <eol>
his recognizances his fines his double vouchers <eol>
who is to be buried in 't ? <eol>
horatio these three years i have taken a note of <eol>
gaffs his kibe . how long hast thou been a <eol>
grave maker ? <eol>
it . here hung those lips that i have kissed i know <eol>
now get you to my lady 's chamber and tell her let <eol>
her paint an inch thick to this favour she must <eol>
alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of <eol>
the queen the courtiers who is this they follow ? <eol>
and with such maimed rites ? this doth betoken <eol>
for though i am not splenitive and rash <eol>
which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand . <eol>
i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers <eol>
make up my sum . what wilt thou do for her ? <eol>
to outface me with leaping in her grave ? <eol>
there 's a divinity that shapes our ends <eol>
their grand commission where i found horatio <eol>
o royal knavery ! an exact command <eol>
no not to stay the grinding of the axe <eol>
being thus be netted round with villanies <eol>
ere i could make a prologue to my brains <eol>
devised a new commission wrote it fair <eol>
how to forget that learning but sir now <eol>
an earnest conjuration from the king <eol>
which was the model of that danish seal <eol>
does by their own insinuation grow <eol>
he that hath kill 'd my king and whored my mother <eol>
and a man 's life 's no more than to say 'one . ' <eol>
for by the image of my cause i see <eol>
know him . he hath much land and fertile let a <eol>
northerly . <eol>
complexion . <eol>
i beseech you remember <eol>
sir his definement suffers no perdition in you <eol>

what 's his weapon ? <eol>
that 's two of his weapons but well . <eol>
liberal conceited carriages that 's the french bet <eol>
how if i answer 'no ' ? <eol>
if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits . <eol>
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will . <eol>
but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out . <eol>
i do not think so since he went into france i <eol>
about my heart but it is no matter . <eol>
but pardon 't as you are a gentleman . <eol>
if hamlet from himself be ta 'en away <eol>
and when he 's not himself does wrong laertes <eol>
who does it then ? his madness if 't be so <eol>

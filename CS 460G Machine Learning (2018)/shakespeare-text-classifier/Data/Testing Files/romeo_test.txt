out <eol>
alas that love whose view is muffled still <eol>
mis shapen chaos of well seeming forms ! <eol>
good heart at what ? <eol>
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast <eol>
doth add more grief to too much of mine own . <eol>
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs <eol>
being purged a fire sparkling in lovers ' eyes <eol>
she will not stay the siege of loving terms <eol>
o she is rich in beauty only poor <eol>
for beauty starved with her severity <eol>
to merit bliss by making me despair <eol>
o teach me how i should forget to think . <eol>
to call hers exquisite in question more <eol>
he that is strucken blind cannot forget <eol>
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget . <eol>
your plaintain leaf is excellent for that . <eol>
not mad but bound more than a mad man is <eol>
whipp 'd and tormented and god den good fellow . <eol>
stay fellow i can read . <eol>
widow of vitravio signior placentio and his lovely <eol>
whither ? <eol>
ne 'er saw her match since first the world begun . <eol>
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ? <eol>
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe <eol>
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels <eol>
nay that 's not so . <eol>
with this night 's revels and expire the term <eol>
of a despised life closed in my breast <eol>
for i ne 'er saw true beauty till this night . <eol>
have not saints lips and holy palmers too ? <eol>
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do <eol>
thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged . <eol>
sin from thy lips ? o trespass sweetly urged ! <eol>
give me my sin again . <eol>
what is her mother ? <eol>
but soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? <eol>
it is the east and juliet is the sun . <eol>
and none but fools do wear it cast it off . <eol>
o that she knew she were ! <eol>
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven <eol>
would through the airy region stream so bright <eol>
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand ! <eol>
call me but love and i 'll be new baptized <eol>
my name dear saint is hateful to myself <eol>
with love 's light wings did i o 'er perch these walls <eol>
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their sight <eol>
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear <eol>
that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops <eol>
wouldst thou withdraw it ? for what purpose love ? <eol>
being in night all this is but a dream <eol>
too flattering sweet to be substantial . <eol>
their books <eol>
like softest music to attending ears ! <eol>
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast ! <eol>
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell . <eol>
good morrow father . <eol>
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine . <eol>
i have forgot that name and that name 's woe . <eol>
where on a sudden one hath wounded me <eol>
within thy help and holy physic lies <eol>
that thou consent to marry us to day . <eol>
good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ? <eol>
mar . <eol>
protest unto thee <eol>
and there she shall at friar laurence ' cell <eol>
farewell commend me to thy mistress . <eol>
that one short minute gives me in her sight <eol>
do thou but close our hands with holy words <eol>
unfold the imagined happiness that both <eol>
as dearly as my own be satisfied . <eol>
gentle mercutio put thy rapier up . <eol>
hold tybalt ! good mercutio ! <eol>
this gentleman the prince 's near ally <eol>
in my behalf my reputation stain 'd <eol>
this day 's black fate on more days doth depend <eol>
away to heaven respective lenity <eol>
now tybalt take the villain back again <eol>
that late thou gavest me for mercutio 's soul <eol>
staying for thine to keep him company <eol>
father what news ? what is the prince 's doom ? <eol>
that i yet know not ? <eol>
for exile hath more terror in his look <eol>
there is no world without verona walls <eol>
in carrion flies than romeo they my seize <eol>
a sin absolver and my friend profess 'd <eol>
doting like me and like me banished <eol>
doth she not think me an old murderer <eol>
with blood removed but little from her own ? <eol>
my conceal 'd lady to our cancell 'd love ? <eol>
'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia 's brow <eol>
my dreams presage some joyful news at hand <eol>
to think ! <eol>
and breathed such life with kisses in my lips <eol>
ah me ! how sweet is love itself possess 'd <eol>
news from verona ! how now balthasar ! <eol>
how doth my lady ? is my father well ? <eol>
well juliet i will lie with thee to night . <eol>
i do remember an apothecary <eol>
and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted <eol>
o this same thought did but forerun my need <eol>
what ho ! apothecary ! <eol>
come hither man . i see that thou art poor <eol>
as will disperse itself through all the veins <eol>
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness <eol>
the world is not thy friend nor the world 's law <eol>
i pay thy poverty and not thy will . <eol>
there is thy gold worse poison to men 's souls <eol>
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none . <eol>
come cordial and not poison go with me <eol>
see thou deliver it to my lord and father . <eol>
is partly to behold my lady 's face <eol>
in what i further shall intend to do <eol>
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs <eol>
than empty tigers or the roaring sea . <eol>
i must indeed and therefore came i hither . <eol>
put not another sin upon my head <eol>
for i come hither arm 'd against myself <eol>
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet <eol>
a grave ? o no ! a lantern slaughter 'd youth <eol>
death lie thou there by a dead man interr 'd . <eol>
and death 's pale flag is not advanced there . <eol>
why art thou yet so fair ? shall i believe <eol>
that unsubstantial death is amorous <eol>
will i set up my everlasting rest <eol>
from this world wearied flesh . eyes look your last ! <eol>
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss <eol>
a dateless bargain to engrossing death ! <eol>
o true apothecary ! <eol>
thy drugs are quick . thus with a kiss i die . <eol>
